Next version of XML Frames will create MY SQL and FIREBIRD Databases, with W4 EXPRESS recent files.

XML Frames uses [W4 EXPRESS](http://www.w4software.com/node/158) XML Files to create your management HMI on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.
It is on DELPHI 2006 and [LAZARUS](http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/).
You can make your analysis on W4 EXPRESS Studio to see your software on DELPHI and LAZARUS executables. The executables are exactly similar with every projects.

With [VRAD, Very Rapid Applications Development](http://liberlog.fr/RAD-HTML-EN/VRAD-LAZARUS.html), your software is made shortly with quality value.

Your analysis is kept. You can easily use your W4 EXPRESS software in Web, Web 2, Android, Java Application, and with XML Frames with an executable application.

There is no Object-relational mapping needed to create the HMI, so less memory needed. Also software is running on client or in 3-Tier.

The micro-components, in [Extended Framework](http://extended.liberlog.fr/), are created with W4 EXPRESS files, by the management components whose are customized with [Man Frames](http://manframes.liberlog.fr/). Self-creating SQL on MY SQL and [Firebird](http://www.firebirdsql.org) made by [Man Frames](http://manframes.liberlog.fr/). You can ask for a short programming for Oracle and others SQL creating.
