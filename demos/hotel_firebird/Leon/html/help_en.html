	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Black"; color:#333399'>Establishments management / Manager list:</span>
	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial"; color:#333399'>This list allows to browse the data of different application classes by navigating the relationships between these classes. It also allows to view image fields within the list.</span>

	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Black"; color:#333399'>Establishments management / Geographical distribution:</span>
	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial"; color:#333399'>This compound view allows to visualize in the same window multiple basic views (a tree, a map, a list). The content of each basic view depends on the current selection in its "parent" view. The following operations are available on the map: zooming (shift+mouse), panning (shift+alt+mouse), moving objects (selection+alt+mouse). The bottom list allows to display or hide rooms for a given hotel by using the arrows placed at the end of the rows.</span>

	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Black"; color:#333399'>Reservations management / Customers list:</span>
	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial"; color:#333399'>This view allows to edit the data displayed in the editable table view, on the left, and also to visualize this data in a details window on the right. The cells of the list with a green cross may be edited by a single click. Hypertext links located under the list allows a quick navigation of this list.</span>

	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Black"; color:#333399'>Reservations management / Planning:</span>
	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial"; color:#333399'>This view of type 'Gantt Planning' allows to visualize data depending on fields of type date (usually a start date and an end date). The planning scale can be changed by moving the pointer on top of the grid. The list located under the planning depends on the planning's current context.</span>

	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Black"; color:#333399'>Reservations management / Distribution:</span>
	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial"; color:#333399'>This view of type 'tree map' allows to glance at various data contained in one application class (in this case, bookings). The size of the rectangles represents a field's value (the amount of a booking in this case) and the color represents another field's value (the daily amount in this case). This component offers an overview of all the objects belonging to an application class. The form located on the right allows fine tuning of the tree map located on the left.</span>

	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial Black"; color:#333399'>Historical record / Reservations:</span>
	<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial"; color:#333399'>This view represents both a filter and a list that contains multiple items. The filter allows to limit the number of items in the list, thus permitting an easier identification of one (or many) given items. After a filter is created, it can either be reinitialized or completed with other filtering criteria.</span>
