WEO_ALREADY_RUNNING=Weo application was probably already started and currently runs or it was not closed earlier. \
If you start a second instance of Weo, you risk data corruption ! \
If no instance of Weo not currently running on your computer is a previous instance was not closed. \
To remedy this problem, delete the file weo.pid in the temporary directory and restart Weo thereafter. \
Do you still start Weo (Not recommended)? 
#
WEO_MANQUE_PARAMETRE=The file "Parameter" is missing. You must exit the application!
